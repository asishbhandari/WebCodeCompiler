# Web-Based Code Compiler

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based compiler that supports compiling code written in multiple programming languages, specifically C++, Solidity, Rust, and Motoko. The compiler provides a seamless experience for developers by allowing them to write, compile, and view the output of their code directly within the application. 

## Features

- **Multi-Language Support**: Write and compile code in C++, Solidity, Rust, or Motoko
- **Code Editor**: An intuitive code editor for each supported language.
- **Compilation**: Backend functionality to compile the code and return the output.


## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
